# NYCDSA_Project-2

R Shiny project with New York City Data Science Academy

The purpose of this project was to explore property data published by Zillow to determine the most profitable real estate opportunity by zipcode. 

The shiny app I worked provides key real estate investment metrics through custom filtering and sorting on an interactive map view and data table. 
The files for operating the shiny app are:
    ui.R
    server.R
    global.R
    gomap.js
    styles.css
    
I also performed a detailed analysis on the data through the following file:
    data_analysis.R
